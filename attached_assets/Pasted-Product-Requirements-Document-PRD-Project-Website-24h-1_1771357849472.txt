Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: Website 24h
1. Product Overview

Website 24h is a premium rapid-delivery web platform specialized in designing, building, and deploying high-quality landing pages and dynamic websites within 24 hours.
Despite the speed, the product explicitly positions itself against low-quality “template farms” by delivering:

Premium design standards

Dynamic, automated functionality

Deep integration with external services

Scalable, maintainable architecture

The core value proposition is speed without compromise: production-ready websites that are visually premium, technically sound, automation-enabled, and business-ready — delivered in a single day.

2. Problem Statement
Market Problems

Traditional agencies are slow, expensive, and process-heavy

Low-cost solutions produce static, generic, non-scalable sites

Businesses increasingly need:

Immediate online presence

Lead capture & automation

Integration with scheduling, email, messaging, and analytics

Time-to-market often matters more than over-customization

Opportunity

There is a gap between:

“Cheap & fast but low quality”

“High quality but slow & expensive”

Website 24h occupies the premium-fast category.

3. Product Vision

To become the fastest premium website delivery service in the market, where businesses can go from idea to fully operational digital presence in 24 hours — without sacrificing design, performance, or automation.

4. Target Users
Primary Users

Startups & early-stage companies

SMEs launching new products/services

Marketing teams running fast campaigns

Freelancers & consultants

Local businesses needing immediate presence

Secondary Users
